GO-SHIP A20 2021 Hydrographic Program
======================================

Cruise Scientific Objectives

The A22 2021 cruise aboard the UNOLS vessel R/V Thomas G. Thompson was undertaken as part of the US GO-SHIP (Global Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic Investigations Program), a major contributor to international GO-SHIP. 
The program's overall objective is to collect quasi-decadal, highly accurate, surface-to-bottom, coast-to-coast, physical, and chemical oceanic observations. 
These measurements are essential to monitoring long-term changes in heat, freshwater, carbon, oxygen, and other tracers in the global ocean-- the main reservoir in the Earth System. 

The A22 meridional transect spans the western North Atlantic from the tropics to the subtropics and is the only GO-SHIP transect in the Caribbean Sea. 
This year, the A22 worked from South America's continental shelf break, near Aruba, to Puerto Rico and thence northwards to Bermuda along the 66o W meridian. 
From Bermuda, the transect stretched to the continental shelf south of Woods Hole, following the Line W path (scienceweb.whoi.edu/linew/index.php). 
This is the first reoccupation of Line W after the end of that program in 2014, whose objective was monitoring the deep limb of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).

Along the way, the A22 transect crossed major western boundary currents systems: the Caribbean Current, the Gulf Stream, and the North Atlantic Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) at different latitudes. 
The latter two are primary conduits of the AMOC. 

Although the A22 transect has been slightly modified over the years, this was the fourth reoccupation of this line in the last three decades. 
The A22 was first occupied in 1997 (79 stations; R/V Knorr) during WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment), then in 2003 (82 stations; R/V Knorr) and 2012 (81 stations; R/V Atlantis) as part of the CLIVAR (Climate Variability and Predictability). 

In 2021, 90 CTD/LADCP/rosette stations were performed over the course of 27-days during boreal spring (20 April - 16 May 2021). 
Stations were nominally spaced by about 30 nm (50 km) in the open-ocean but closer (<= 15 nm) at boundary currents and major topographic features. 
At each station, a suite of surface to bottom vertical profiles was collected using electronic sensors (CTDO, LADCPS, chi-pods, transmissometer, UVP (Underwater Vision Profile)), and 36 Niskin bottles for sampling water at discrete vertical levels. 

Data collected during the A22 2021 were (some samplings will be processed in labs onshore):  

*	Pressure, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen 
*	Fluorescence, shear and micro-scale temperature
*	Current velocities from lowered and shipboard ADCPs
*	Major nutrients (silicate, phosphate, nitrate, nitrite)
*	Transient tracers (Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC-11 and 12), Sulphur Hexafluoride (|SF6|) and Nitrous Oxide (|N2O|)) 
*	Carbon components: total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity, pH, and partial pressure of |CO2|, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN)
*	Nitrate isotopes and radiocarbons 
*	HPLC pigments and particulate organic carbon (POC)
*	Sargassum seaweed
*	Bathymetry and shipboard meteorological observations
*	UVP high-resolution digital images to study large (>100 Âµm) particles and zooplankton
*	Size-fractioned microbial respiration
*	|d18O| (ratio of stable isotopes oxygen-18 and oxygen-16) and :math:`\delta`\D (Deuterium) for studying the hydrological cycle

In addition to the above measurements, during the A22 8 Argo (Core), 4 Go-BGC and 2 RAFOS floats, and 19 solar-powered spotter buoys (measuring wave, wind, and sea surface temperature) were deployed.
