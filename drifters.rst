Sofar Spotter Drifter Deployments
=================================

A total of 19 Sofar Ocean Technologies Spotter drifters were deployed on the A22 cruise (https://www.sofarocean.com/products/spotter). 
Co-chief scientist Jesse Anderson and R/V Thompson SSGs Elizabeth Ricci and Stephen Jalickee were in charge of the deployments. 
Additional assistance was provided by multiple science party members. 
The drifters were deployed by dropping them over the port stern while the vessel steamed away from station or during transits between stations. 
Parameters measured are complete wave spectrum and winds (speed and direction, derived from wave spectra). 
All spotters deployed are working well. 
Data will be publicly available as per Level 3 data requirements of the GO-SHIP program. 

SOFAR technologies provided the following description: Sofar Ocean Technologies is deploying a global free-floating metocean sensor array which develops new assimilation strategies to im- prove global ocean weather forecast models. 
The network of Sofar buoys make observations of real-time ocean conditions including surface winds, waves and currents, and transmit the data back to shore through an integrated satellite connection. 
Sofar is working to expand its coverage in the Atlantic, Indian, and Southern Oceans by utilizing Ship of Opportunity partner groups, with all data from the global network publicly available in real time through the Sofar Weather Dashboard. 
Data exports are also available to partner groups as part of our research grants program, either directly to deployment partners, or through our Climate Initiative. 
Sofarâ€™s work is funded in part by the US Office of Naval Research, which has sponsored several research projects including an upcoming effort to directly observe hurricane activity in the Atlantic in order to improve hurricane forecasting and operational tracking systems.
