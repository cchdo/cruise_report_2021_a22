Equipment and Techniques
------------------------

Dissolved oxygen analyses were performed with an SIO/ODF-designed automated oxygen titrator using photometric end-point detection based on the absorption of 365nm wavelength ultra-violet light.
The titration of the samples and the data logging were controlled by PC LabView software. Thiosulfate was dispensed by a Dosimat 665 buret driver fitted with a 1.0 ml burette.

ODF used a whole-bottle modified-Winkler titration following the technique of Carpenter [Carpenter1965]_ with modifications by [Culberson1991]_ but with higher concentrations of potassium iodate standard (~0.012 N), and thiosulfate solution (~55 g/L).

Pre-made liquid potassium iodate standards and reagent/distilled water blanks were run every day (approximately every 3-4 stations), with samples analysed within 24 hours of the last standard.

Sampling and Data Processing
----------------------------

A total of 2969 oxygen measurements were made, all of which were niskin samples.
There are no underway samples.
Niskin samples were collected soon after the rosette was secured on deck, either from fresh niskins or immediately following CFC sampling.

Nominal 125 mL volume-calibrated biological oxygen demand (BOD) flasks were rinsed 3 times with minimal agitation using a silicone draw tube, then filled and allowed to overflow for at least 3 flask volumes, ensuring no bubbles remained. Pickling reagents MnCl2 and NaI/NaOH (1 mL of each) were added via bottle-top dispensers to fix samples before stoppering. Flasks were shaken twice (10-12 inversions) to assure thorough dispersion of the precipitate - once immediately after drawing and then again after 30-60 minutes.

Sample draw temperatures, measured with an electronic resistance temperature detector (RTD) embedded in the draw tube, were used to calculate umol/kg concentrations, and as a diagnostic check of bottle integrity.

Niskin samples were analysed within 2-12 hours of collection, and the data incorporated into the cruise database. Underway samples were analysed within 96 hours of collection.

Thiosulfate normalities were calculated for each standardisation and corrected to 20°C. The 20°C thiosulfate normalities and blanks were plotted versus time and were reviewed for possible problems, and were subsequently determined to be stable enough that no smoothing was required.

Volumetric Calibration
----------------------

Oxygen flask volumes were determined gravimetrically with degassed deionised water to determine flask volumes at ODF's chemistry laboratory. This is done once before using flasks for the first time and periodically thereafter when a suspect volume is detected. The 10 mL Dosimat buret used to dispense standard iodate solution was calibrated using the same method.

Standards
---------

Liquid potassium iodate standards were prepared in 6 L batches and bottled in sterile glass bottles at ODF's chemistry laboratory prior to the expedition. The normality of the liquid standard was determined by calculation from weight. The standard was supplied by Alfa Aesar and has a reported purity of 99.4-100.4%. All other reagents were "reagent grade" and were tested for levels of oxidising and reducing impurities prior to use.

Narrative
---------
The analytical rig remained set up from the just completed 2021 occupation of A20.
This included all the reagents, though more NaI/OH and MnCl2 were made while in port.

The thiosulfate stability was considered in 4 batches and showed remarkable stability throughout the entire cruise.
No trends were observed or corrected for.

There was a freezing concern regarding the liquid reagents shipped to WHOI prior to the start of A20.
To verify that our standards were good, some OSIL KIO3 standard was shipped to the US Virgin Islands to load during the port call.
These standards were all run during the transit around Puerto Rico (between stations 29 and 30).
All the ODF standards agreed with each other, the OSIL standards were inconclusive.
Though perhaps the lesson learned was that the lead analyst lacked sufficient skill with hand pipettes to use them.

No data updates are expected.
